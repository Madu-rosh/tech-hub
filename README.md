# Tech Hub Platform

## Introduction

Welcome to the Tech Hub Platform, a comprehensive solution designed to bridge the gap between technology enthusiasts, developers, and learners. This application is built using the MERN stack, integrating MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js into a seamless experience. Our platform combines client-side and server-side components to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application.

## Features

Plan to support more features but initially address these 

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login functionalities with roles
- **Interactive Posts**: Engage in discussions, share ideas, and solve tech-related queries.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/tech-hub-platform.git
```

2. **Install NPM packages**

Navigate to root and try the command to install dependencies for both server and client. In case you need to do the installation separately you can use the other commands provided

```bash
# For Both server and client
npm install-all

# For server
npm install-server

# For client
npm install-client
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

Create `.env` files in both the client and server directories. Update them with your MongoDB URI, JWT secret, and any other configurations.

4. **Run the application**

To start both the server and client simultaneously from the root directory:

```bash
npm start
```
